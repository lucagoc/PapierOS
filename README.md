## Description
A Debian customisation to use old x86 tablets as a book / comic / manga reading device.

## Details
PapierOS is not and will not be a linux distro on its own. It still use the depot of Debian so it might brake someday (eventhough Debian is super stable).

## Installation
Run a fresh installation of Debian and then run the script as root (or with sudo). Let the magic happened.

## FAQ
### What version of Debian should i use to run this customisation ?
As time of writing, this customization has been only tested on Debian 12 (Bookworm) stable.

### Will there be an ISO with the customisation available?
I'm still learning how to do it, so maybe.
